                You may have heard of ChatGPT, a powerful language model that can generate human-like text. But how does it really work? Here's a quick overview:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ChatGPT learned by reading tons of text from books, websites, and other sources to understand how people use language. It doesn’t “know” things in the way people do, but it has seen many examples of language and ideas.</li>
                <li>When you give ChatGPT a prompt, it uses patterns it learned from the data to predict the most likely next word in a sequence. This is how it generates text that seems coherent and contextually relevant.</li>
                <li>As it predicts new words, those words get added to the context, and a new word is generated based on that </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <!-- ChatGPT is a type of language model that generates text by predicting the most likely next word in a sequence, based on patterns it has learned from vast amounts of data. 
                Essentially, ChatGPT takes in a prompt, analyzes its context, and determines the next word through probabilistic reasoning.
                This approach allows it to produce responses that seem coherent and contextually relevant, making it effective in generating human-like conversations and answers. -->

            <h2>How ChatGPT Sees your problem</h2>
            <p>
                Lets play a game to understand how ChatGPT works. Each round a word of the true sentence will be revealed, and both you and a language model will attempt to predict the next word.  
            </p>
            <!--Add a note that this is not chatGPT, but the less powerfull llama model-->

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> This is a simplified version of how ChatGPT works, using a less powerful model called Llama. The goal is to give you a hands-on experience of predicting words based on context.

            <h2>What is a model?</h2>
            <p>
                Lets imagine you want to predict someones salary in a certain role.
                You could try to guess it based on your own intuition, but how do you know if your guess is accurate?
                
                A mathematical model is a representation of a system, process, or concept using mathematical concepts and language. 
                <br/>
                Lets make a very simple model to predict someones salary based on their years of experience. The equation will be:
                <br/>
                <code>salary = slope * experience + intercept</code>
                <br/>
                Where "slope" and "intercept" are numbers that we can adjust to make the model fit the data better. In this instance, the intercept represents the starting salary, and the slope represents how much the salary increases with each year of experience.
            </p>
            <h3>"Training" a model</h3>
            <p>
                If I told you that someone with 2 years of experience makes $18/hour, and 2 people with 5 years of experience make $25 and $30/hour, could you use that information to make a better guess?
                This is the idea behind training. You use the relevant information you have to make a better guess.
                <br/>
                Lets see how this works in practice. Try adjusting the "slope" and "intercept" sliders to fit your model to the data.
            </p>
            <iframe id="modeliframe" src="models.html" width="100%" height="700px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>
                But wait, how can a computer do this? Most people can eyeball a line and see how well it fits the data, but a computer needs a more systematic approach. 
                <br/>
                First we need to define what "better" means. In this case, we can say that a better model is one that makes predictions that are closer to the true values.
                <br/>
                Specifically, we can define the "residual" as the difference between the true value and the value the model predicts. Click the button below to see the residuals for the current model.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <button class="btn btn-primary" id="showRisiduals">Show Residuals</button>
                <p>
                    Now, how can we adjust the slope and intercept to make the residuals smaller? This is where "gradient descent" comes in.
                    <br/>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you where to make a very small adjustment to the slope and intercept. Would the residuals get smaller or larger? If they get smaller, you should keep adjusting in that direction. If they get larger, you should adjust in the opposite direction.
                    <br/>
                    This is the basic idea behind gradient descent. You start with a random guess for the slope and intercept, and then adjust them in the direction that makes the residuals smaller.
                    <br/>
                    Lets see how this works in practice. Click the button below to start the gradient descent algorithm.
                </p>
                <button class="btn btn-primary" id="startGradientDescent">Start Gradient Descent</button>
                <p>
                    Alright! now we have a model! Lets say we used the people in our team to train the model, and now we want to see how well it does on a random team within our company. This is called "testing" or "evaluating" the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click the button below to see how well our model does on an unseen dataset with similar characteristics.
                </p>
                <button class="btn btn-primary" id="testModel">Test Model</button>
                <p>
                    Pretty good! It seems like our model is able to predict the salary of people with a similar background to the people we used to train the model.
                    <br/>
                    This is the basic idea behind machine learning. You use data to train a model, and then test it on new data to see how well it generalizes.
                    <br/>
                    ChatGPT is vastly more complicated, but it operates on the same principle. 
                    In its case, however, instead of 2 sliders it has over <b>1.5 billion parameters</b> that it adjusts to make the best predictions it can.
                    As you can imagine, training a model like ChatGPT is a massive undertaking that requires a lot of data and computational power.

            <h2>Under the Hood [IN PROGRESS]</h2>
            <p>
                OK, so how does ChatGPT actually predict the next word? Whats the intuition behind what these billions of parameters mean?
                Here's a simplified version of ChatGPT's inner workings:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, the text is broken into tokens. These are usually words, but can be fragments of words</li>
                <li>Next, the model has a list of numbers it uses to represent each token. This tries to capture as much of the meaning as possible</li>
                <li>Then, the model updates the meaning of the token based on the surrounding context and the meaning of the words around it</li>
                <li>Now the model tries to understand the meaning of the entire text based on the meaning of each word</li>
                <li>Finally, the model predicts the next word based on the meaning of the text so far</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This is a very simplified version of what happens under the hood. In reality, the model is much more complex and uses many more steps to predict the next word. 
                But understanding each of these steps in more detail can help you understand how ChatGPT works and what its strengths and limitations are.
